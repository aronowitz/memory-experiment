Thank you for your participation in this study. Your participation is important because it helps contribute to our understanding of the different psychological factors 
that influence the ability to remember information. We hope that by seeing how people perform on the task that you completed today will help us learn more about the ways that 
people structure information that they want to recall. Our overarching goal was to compare three different factors that we believe influence remembering: temporal order, 
spatial arrangement, and semantic relatedness. All participants saw the same museum floor plans, but there were differences in the museum details across trials. 
However, the general format of the task was the same for everyone. We simply varied whether the items appeared in a specific order, specific locations, or featured words 
with different semantic relationships. This experiment is part of some exploratory research about the nature of human remembering; we did not design the task with particular 
hypotheses in mind. We hope that the results of this study will lead to an understanding of human memory that can support such hypothesizing and discovery in the future. 
All of the responses that you have provided throughout this study will kept completely confidential, and will not be linked in any with your name or other personal information.
